== Hero guide todo-list ==
==========================
 
I consolidated here all the comments and questions I had from your updates
as well as things from my old todo list (mostly user feedback that I haven't
put into the guide yet)

This might seem a little negative, but that is just because
 I put the things I agreed with into the guide already.

 - is for comments on your updates
 + is for extra comments, either mine or from playdota and reddit feedback.

ES
    - In my replay data, only LGD.Chuan gets totem at 4. Everyone else getis it at 8.
      Is this a parser glitch of is it important?

SVEN
    - Why the soul ring?

CLOCK
    - Why the 2-flare, 2-battery, 2-flare, 2-battery build?
    + Flesh out build variations (explain why the weird build)

ALCH
    + We need to split the radiance/non-radiance build.
    + Does that sobi mask trick also work in dota2?
    + move explanation to the hero intro;

WISP
    + see http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11vvss/enjoy_playing_wisp_here_is_a_tiny_guide_on_some/
    
      + Tether does not transfer health/mana regen if have full health/mana. You can use overcharge to spend a bit of health.
      
      + Quickly toggling overcharge for the damage reduction can help against nukes.
      
      + Its easier to control the spirits if they are close to you.
      
      + > You can make your spirits "stop" at more places than max and min. Simply pressing out/in twice makes the spirits stop where they are. 
      
      + When you cast spirits the current ones explode immediately. Use this for ganking and for farming neutrals.
      
      + Regeneration items are very good on wisp - they work well with Tether and Overcharge costs a percentage of your total health.
      
      tranquils, urn, wand

JUGGER
    + Currently lacks a hero description (only has tips).

LUNA    
    + Luna is the fastest hero in the game, goes mid,
      and gains more early game from lunar blessing than stats.
      Early bottle is important, as luna can control runes better than most,
      and can set up easy kills at level 7 due to having 1500 damage between Q/R.

LD
    + We should have a non-radiance build.
    + How does entangle + quelling blade work in Dota2?

STORM
    - Explain build variations.

RHASTA:
    + My replay data gives very varied skill builds, often not maxing voodoo first.
      We should get more concrete data, and decide if the current build is a good default.
    + Easy build -> change name; explain.

ENCH
    + Remove that silly smoke

SILENCER
    + The silencer guide has always sucked (uncommon hero with greatly varied playstyle).
      Perhaps creating tabs for the carry and support biuld woul dhelp this issue?

OGRE
    + Should we mention aghs or reject it?
    
PUDGE:
    + Get a single point in Flesh Heap at 4.

SB:
    + MoM is controversial, since its so snowbally.
      Perhaps we should use a "safer' build as the default?
    + I don't understand the CoD vision mechanics.
    
CK:
    + (fireblaze): I never liked the armlet build.
       I'd reccomend something like Treads->Jango / VG -> HoT / Manta.
    
    + I think it makes makes sense to make the armlet build more optional
      (it is something you can go for, but surely not obligatory like in Leoric's case)
      
      typo: juts

WEAVER:
    + We should check the new non-radiance build. I suck at weaver.
      Also needs to make the hero description better, to lessen confusion.
  
WD:
    + We should add separate tabs for the maledict and voodoo restoration skill builds.

ENIGMA:
    + Needs more suggested items.
    
NECRO
    + Do we really go with HA at 2, even with sadist now healing HP?

KROB:
    + Add more luxury items to the MS itembuild.

LESH:
    + We should add the tabs back in (there is more then one way to play lesh)
      The text got outdated because of this too.
    + Do we need all those bracers in the stats build?

INVOKER:
    + (jtrager)
        Suggested QW build: qrqwqwrwwwwerweereqeeeqqqï»¿
        Has more early quas.
        
        Should change exort items; Use treads as the boots.
        Starting: tango,2 branches,circlet,Gauntlet

OD:
    Mek/Nulls  in optional

== Dota1 heroes without guides

LC:
    + (noworries)
      So many ways to play this guy. My personal favorite is the good ol jungling route

        Jungle
        MoC 1 3 5 7
        OO 4 8 9 10
        PtA 2 12 13 14
        Ult 6 11 16

        Starting
          QB/Stout/Tango
        Core
          Phase/Lothars(Dagger)
        Extend
          Battlefury/Buriza/Satanic/Blademail

        Lane
        MoC 4 8 9 10
        OO 1 3 5 7
        PtA 2 12 13 14
        Ult 6 11 16

        Tresdin is powerful at all stages of the game.
        MoC works like Counter Helix in reverse allowing for epic fights to the death.
        OO is a good nuke which gives him some laning presence.
        PtA is technically a buff but is more often a good solid heal.

        [*]Early on, Use duel on dying enemies.
           After 3-4 duels the damage really starts to stack up
        [*]Remember to OO/PtA before dueling someone
        [*]In team fights, Duel the SUPPORT heroes, not the enemy carries.
           Since Duel dooms both targets, it can be very helpful to kill
           warlocks before they infernal, or Lions before they hex
        [*]Lothars works well, Dagger I would say if you are doing not so well
        [*]Most builds work on him, however I find with Battlefury/Buriza
           you either win the team fight or are going to lose the game.
           With MoC, cleave, and crits you can do very well taking out
           entire teams if supported with silence as auto-attackers should lose to you

SHREDDER:
    + (noworries)
      Lots of ways to do him. He is a ninja that is very hard to kill
      but gulps up Mana like sluts do jizz.

        Armor 3 12 13 14
        Whirl 2 8 9 10
        Chain 1 4 5 7
        Ult 6 11 16

      Starting
        Stout/Branch/Branch/Branch/Tango/Cp/Cp
      Core
        Arcane/Wand-->Bloodstone
      Extensions
        Heart/Shivas/AC

      [*]Chain has good range, does pure damage, and has a low cd,
         spam it frequently during team fights
      [*]Chain also requires trees. Try to lane not mid
      [*]Death does pure damage if by trees and has
         a large AoE, keep that in mind
      [*]Death also lowers the primary attribute, of course try to
         hit all the enemies, but in no order
         Agility-->Strength-->Intelligence helps a bit more
 
XIN:

== Dota1 heroes, in general

LoA:
   + (fireblaze) I suggest you change the build into a more hybrid one because just like omni, abba fails as a hard core support hero which you suggested. Try and get an item that gives both HP, mana and also some dps in.
   
    Phase->Urn+basi->Jango gives awesome stats and is great for whatever you plan on doing.
    Extensions can be pipe if your team needs it, maelstorm, or even basher.
    
   + (kris) Go for tranquil; pushing overextending enemies with your healing skills.

TUSKAR:
    + Crappy build in general, should update.

TC:
    + Needs major guide overhaul. I heard he is finally being picked by the Chineese,
      so we can get better data on him now.

BB:
    + Decide if we go for 1 point in goo, maxing goo or no goo at all.
    
PIT:
    + (no worries)
      While I agree Expulsion is very strong, early on the number of
      creeps available to it are low-->none.
      Rather, Firestorm is strong and stays very strong early and
      can likewise push towers like no problem.
      Also, Dark Rift can be just as effective at 6 as any time afterwards.
        Pit 1 8/9/10 12/13/14
        Firestorm 2 3 5 7
        Expulsion 4 12/13/14 8/9/10
        Rift 6 11 16
      Taking levels or Pit or expulsion depends on your line-up.
      Pit provides better disable while expulsion is better push/anti push and team fight

TROLL:
    + Max fervor or max bash?

SLARK:
    + (kenshiro, xyLoneZ)
      Armlet is good for giving an HP and DPS boost.
      Ult gives health regen and HotD becomes mandatory for keeping up in fights.

TB:
    + (noworries)
        Holy wow there's about 100 ways to play him;
        here's 3 general ideas though and the skill build
        doesn't change a whole lot between them

        ----------------
        Reflection 1 8 9 10 12 13 14
        Meta 3 4 5 7
        Zeal 2 12 13 14 8 9 10
        Ult 6 11 16

        Meta is his strongest steroid skill, max it by 7.
        Reflection verse Zeal, depends.
        Zeal is a bit stronger if you plan on ricing and farming a bit more,
        whereas Reflection allows you to participate in ganks and nab kills.
        Some people would say to skip Sunder all together
         although I do find it helpful in spots
         

        1. Stat Build

        Starting
          QB/Stout/Tango
        Core
          Manta/Treads/PMS/RoA
        Extend
          Skadi/Butterfly/Buriza

        Thanks to Meta and Zeal, your images will do SICK damage.
        However, due to their some 300% damage amplification,
        this build really only works in 2 cases, either you have Silencer on your team
        or the opponents lack AoE, and by lack AoE they need less than 3 spells that are AoE.
        There is no doubt this build gives the best dps but this only occurs
        if the images can attack for their entire duration

        2. Mid-game Carry

        Start
          QB/Stout/Tango
        Core
          Treads/Maelstrom/BkB/HH
        Extend
          Mojin/Buriza

        The idea here is to not build him about his images,
        rather abuse Zeal and his new found range with Metamorph.
        With Treads/BkB/HH you find yourself with ample health (something TB lacks)
        as well as spell immunity allowing you to outlast most other heroes.
        Maelstrom-->Mojin gives him AoE presence as well.
        This is probably his safest way to play him.

        3. Rice Carry

        Start
          QB/Stout/Tango
        Core
          HotD/Treads/PMS
        Extend
          BkB/Buriza/Satanic/DR

        The idea here is use Hotd/Zeal to clear jungles/ancients very fast and rice it up.
        With BkB/Satanic and range, he can then safely wield Divine Rapier and
        just tear opponents apart.
        Obviously this build is risky and is best suited around a turtle line-up

== Style guide ==
=================

I found that I had written some of these rules for myself a while ago.
Having these formalized might help us define a guide "ideal" to follow
 as well as help make things more consistent (now that we have multiple people writing things).

* The hero description should be one or two paragraphs explaining what the hero is about.
  This shold contain information you learn from playing *against* the hero, but not
  information you need when playing *as* the hero.
  
  The hero should be mentioned in the third prerson.

* The hero tips should be written in a consise bullet-point style,
  in order of importance (most important first).
  
  We should list things that help when playing the hero, but don't arise obviously
  when reading the skill tooltips of finding the hero in the first time.
  
  Hero tips should be written in the imperative form, adressing the player.
  
  More detailed tips about build variations and mechanics should go in separate tabs.
  
* The builds should be standard and non-controversial.

  -  If there are multiple "standard" builds for a hero, we should choose one
     as the default (erring on the side of the easiest one to play).

     Additional builds should be mentioned in separate tabs (so that we don't lose
     the information that there are separate builds). This helps maintaining the guide in
     the future, since its easier to change the default build when the meta changes
     then it is to come up with the build all over again if
     we didn't write it down in the first place.

  - The idea is that less things can go wrong if you mindlessly copy a cookie-cutter build.
   (Remember: this is an alt-tab guide and we don't have all the time in the world
    to explain more subtle things)
    
  - I usually take my builds from high level and competive replays.
    This gives an aspect of scientific reproducibility,
    although it might make some builds less accessible to pub play

* Do *not* include boilerplate content that takes up space without much benefit.
  - Obvious combos you get from just reading the tooltips.
  - "Rejected Item" sections, telling not to get Buriza on Crystal Maiden.
  - "Hero Counter" sections. I hate these.

* An exception is made for rejecting trap builds (that look fine on paper but suck).
  For example, Aghanim's Scepter on OD / Necrolyte and Butterfly on Mortred.

* Essential skill or item interactions should be pointed out
  (ex.: Tinker Travels, Sand King Blink, Kunkka X+Torrent, Tiny AvaToss)

* If a skill has confusing tooltips or is generally often confused/miscast it should be explained. ex.: AA Blast, Kunkka ship.

  - This is the kind of stuff you can often get wrong the first time you play a hero yourself, even though you might have already known his skills from when playing against him.

* Common misconceptions should be listed.
